## Microsoft Azure Cloud Services  

- **Microsoft Azure** is a cloud computing platform created by Microsoft.  
- It provides a wide range of services (like servers, databases, networking, AI tools, and storage) over the internet instead of using physical hardware at your place.  
- **In simple words**: Azure lets you build, run, and manage applications or services in the cloud without worrying about buying and maintaining actual servers.  
- Available in **60+ regions worldwide**, ensuring fast and reliable access everywhere.  
- **Scalability & Flexibility** → Resources can scale up or down instantly based on demand.
