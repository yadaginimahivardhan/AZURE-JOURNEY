### Cloud Deployment Models Theory  
- **Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud**  
- Real-world use cases for each  

### Hands-on  
- Make a comparison table of Public vs Private vs Hybrid Cloud  
- Identify which cloud model Gmail, Teams, and Banking apps belong to

## Cloud Deployment Models  

### 1. Public Cloud  
**Definition:**  
Cloud infrastructure owned and operated by third-party providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Resources are shared among multiple organizations.  

**Features:**  
- Pay-as-you-go  
- Scalable and flexible  
- Accessible over the internet  

**Real-World Use Case:**  
- Hosting websites  
- Email services  
- Online storage  
- Collaboration tools  

---

### 2. Private Cloud  
**Definition:**  
Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, hosted on-premises or by a service provider.  

**Features:**  
- High security and control  
- Customized to business needs  
- More expensive than public cloud  

**Real-World Use Case:**  
- Banking systems  
- Government organizations  
- Healthcare systems with strict compliance  

---

### 3. Hybrid Cloud  
**Definition:**  
Combination of public and private cloud, allowing data and apps to move between them.  

**Features:**  
- Flexibility and scalability  
- Sensitive data kept private, general workloads in public cloud  
- Complex to manage  

**Real-World Use Case:**  
- Enterprises needing both security for sensitive data and scalability for customer apps

### Comparison Table: Public vs Private vs Hybrid Cloud  

| Feature       | Public Cloud                               | Private Cloud                              | Hybrid Cloud                                     |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Ownership** | Third-party provider                       | Single organization                        | Shared (mix of both)                            |
| **Cost**      | Low (Pay-as-you-go)                        | High (dedicated infrastructure)            | Moderate (depends on mix)                       |
| **Security**  | Standard, shared environment               | Very High (dedicated environment)          | High (critical apps private, others public)     |
| **Scalability** | Very High                                | Limited by resources                       | High (leverages both)                           |
| **Control**   | Limited                                    | Full                                      | Balanced                                        |
| **Use Cases** | Email, web apps, collaboration tools       | Banking, government, healthcare            | E-commerce, enterprise IT, large corporations   |

### Examples  
- **Gmail** ‚Üí Public Cloud (hosted on Google Cloud, shared globally)  
- **Microsoft Teams** ‚Üí Public Cloud (runs on Microsoft Azure as a SaaS)  
- **Banking Apps** ‚Üí Private Cloud (due to strict security & compliance)  
  - *(Some modern banks also use Hybrid Cloud for customer services + secure transaction systems.)*
